# epilespy_regression_predictions

In this study we have used several Machine Learning models for the regression question of predicting number of Emergency visits. In an earlier study, a classification analysis was done to investigate a patient as a high utilizer if she visited the ED more than once in a year. With the clinical feature space comprising of diagnosis, ccs conditions, frailty indicator, disabled flags, palliative care indicators (over than 300 features) high accuracy was noted for the binary classification task. 
In this study the problem of regression has been undertaken. I use Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, Tree algorithms (CART, RandomForest, Adaboost) and Support Vector Machines. In epilepsy_nn.py a 3 layer Feed forward Neural Network model has been implemented. Mean squared error is reported. 
I have seperately imputed continuous (mean value) and categorical variables (most frequent). Categorical variables have been one hot encoded. (epilepsy_preprocess.py)
I have used sklearn library in Python for the machine learning models. I have used both Randomized and Grid Search for cross-validation. I have implement a 5 fold cross-validation for hyper-parameters.
